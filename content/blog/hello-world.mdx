This is my first blog post! What's the point however? Why even make a blog post? One reason is that think this is an important step in learning how blogs work in the first place. How I can create mdx files and populate the site. The other reason, I want to share my thoughts and give you an inside of how I view this career.

## The origin

I have been learning web dev for about one year now. It has been a wild ride. I have learned so many things very quick and have at the same time realized how complex web development can get. I am only a student to the game but am motivated by the challenge

I currently work as a Digital Marketing Specialist creating graphics, analyzing data, and managing social media sites. This was the precursor to me being interested in building websites myself. It started as a simple, can I put text to a webpage and upload it to the internet. I was looking at code as if it was a foreign language, frightened even.

I watched a couple of youtube videos and made some very basic sites. None of them had any valuable functionality and I had not even addressed Javascript but I was proud of what I made. It was a challenge and I felt happy that I was able to complete it. But I was yearning for more. It actually felt fun, this introduced me to Scrimba.

Scrimba is an online platform which teaches you frontend development. After doing my research, it was either between this or a bootcamp. I ultimately decided to do the Frontend development career path and dedicate time to complete the course. What a challenge that was. As I completed the lessons, learning important aspects of clean code: accessibility, semantic tags, and responsive design really helped me learn the right way. Then came the javascript...

I was running on a high from completing the HTML and CSS sections. I thought, it wasn't so bad. Then Javascript came into play. This logic of thinking was foreign to me. I struggled hard with created basic function, dealing with closures, and learning all the methods. To this day, I am still struggling with all of the array and object methods (this is what google is for). However this new skill set unleashed a whole new level in my programming game. I began to look into creating functionality in my websites. I learned about API's and data fetching.

```
import { useState, useCallback } from "react";

export default function useMovieSearch() {
  const [movies, setMovies] = useState([]);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const [totalResults, setTotalResults] = useState(0);
  const BASE_URL = `https://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=c47d8db3&`;

  const searchMovies = useCallback(async (searchTerm, page = 1) => {
    setIsLoading(true);
    setError(null);

    if (!searchTerm) {
      setMovies([]);
      setIsLoading(false);
      setTotalResults(0);
      return;
    }

    try {
      const response = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}s=${searchTerm}&page=${page}`);
      const data = await response.json();
      setMovies(data.Search || []);
      setTotalResults(parseInt(data.totalResults) || 0);
    } catch (error) {
      setError("Error fetching movie data");
      console.error("Error fetching movie data:", error);
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  }, []);

  return { movies, isLoading, error, totalResults, searchMovies };
}

```

this was a project I made which fetched movies from an API and populated a list of movies. Data fetching is used in web development all the time and it was something I needed to master. With practice and a lot of hours, I was able to create this function to create the functionality for my app.

## Creating a portfolio

I needed to get the ground running and create relevant projects that showed that I actually know what I am doing. I started by creating a simple MERN todo app. I learned a lot about the backend (thanks ChatGPT) and was able to set up a server which held my todo posts. This is was very cool and very different from what I had done before...

```
import express from "express";
import { MongoClient } from "mongodb";
import cors from "cors";
import multer from "multer";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
import { Router } from "express";

dotenv.config();

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5038;
const CONNECTION_STRING = process.env.MONGO_URI;
const DATABASE_NAME = "todoapp";

app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());

const connectToDatabase = async () => {
  try {
    const client = await MongoClient.connect(CONNECTION_STRING, {
      useUnifiedTopology: true,
    });
    console.log("MongoDB connection successful");
    return client.db(DATABASE_NAME);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to connect to MongoDB:", error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
};

const createRouter = (database) => {
  const router = Router();

  router.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.send("Welcome to the API!");
  });

  router.get("/api/todoapp/GetNotes", async (req, res) => {
    try {
      const notes = await database
        .collection("todoappcollection")
        .find({})
        .toArray();
      res.json(
        notes.map((note) => ({ id: note.id, description: note.description }))
      );
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error retrieving notes:", error);
      res.status(500).send("Error retrieving notes");
    }
  });

  router.post("/api/todoapp/AddNotes", async (req, res) => {
    try {
      console.log("Received request body:", req.body);
      const { description } = req.body;
      if (!description) {
        console.log("Description is missing");
        return res.status(400).json({ message: "Description is required" });
      }
      const count = await database
        .collection("todoappcollection")
        .countDocuments();
      const newId = (count + 1).toString();
      const result = await database.collection("todoappcollection").insertOne({
        id: newId,
        description,
      });
      console.log("Inserted document:", result);
      res.status(201).json({
        message: "Note added successfully",
        note: { id: newId, description },
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error adding note:", error);
      res
        .status(500)
        .json({ message: "Error adding note", error: error.toString() });
    }
  });

  router.delete("/api/todoapp/DeleteNotes", async (req, res) => {
    try {
      const { id } = req.query;
      if (!id) {
        return res.status(400).json({ message: "ID parameter is required" });
      }
      const result = await database
        .collection("todoappcollection")
        .deleteOne({ id });
      if (result.deletedCount === 0) {
        return res.status(404).json({ message: "Note not found" });
      }
      res.status(200).json({ message: "Note removed successfully", result });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error removing note:", error);
      res.status(500).send("Error removing note");
    }
  });

  return router;
};

const startServer = async () => {
  const database = await connectToDatabase();
  const router = createRouter(database);
  app.use(router);

  app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
  });
};

startServer().catch(console.error);


```

With the help of youtube and ChatGPT I was able to create a simple backend with multiple routes: post, get, patch, and delete. I learned how to work with a database (mongoDB) and how that stores my data to display for the frontend. I still do not consider my self proficient in backend in any way, but It was a cool project to gain exposure to the subject. In the future, I'm looking to create more projects including backend as I ultimately want to become a fullstack developer.

## Web design

Along with learning the basics of REST API's, I wanted to practice my skills in web design and UX/UI. I created a simple barbershop website which grabs the attention of the user.

<img src="/scbss.png" alt="My Image" />

This was a fun project which flexed my HTML & CSS skills and showed that I could create responsive sites which are accessible.

## My future

My goal is to become a frontend developer. I am passionate about the subject and look to learn new things every day. In the near future, I want to delve into the world of animations with GSAP and Framer Motion. Right now however, I am looking for a job. Until then, I will keep studying and creating projects. Thanks for reading this super long blog post of me rambling. I hope I can connect with some of you in the future!
